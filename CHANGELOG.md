- `rigtop`: btop-inspired terminal UI
  - CPU total graph and per-core meters, CPU temperatures (Tctl/Tccd on AMD),
    CPU package + GPU power total, fan speeds
  - Memory, GPUs (NVIDIA via NVML: utilization, VRAM, temperature, power),
    network with link speeds (Wi-Fi bit rate and signal on Linux)
  - Storage health: filesystem usage, per-device I/O with NVMe temperature,
    SMART status and age, btrfs RAID profiles with live error counters and
    the last scrub, mdadm array state
  - Process list with per-process GPU usage and VRAM, sorting, filtering,
    kernel thread toggle, SIGTERM/SIGKILL behind a confirmation, mouse support
  - Layout adapts to the terminal size; clock in the CPU box
  - `--dump-json` prints one snapshot for scripting and debugging
- `rigtop-gui`: native GUI (egui) with the same panels, resizable and
  rearrangeable, zoomable (Ctrl + wheel, Ctrl + `+`/`-`/`0`), with the layout
  and zoom restored on start
- Configuration file (`config.toml`) for sensor names and hidden channels
- `contrib/collect`: root systemd timer that collects SMART data and btrfs
  scrub results for rigtop without running rigtop as root
- Windows support (CPU, memory, processes, network with link speeds, drives,
  NVIDIA GPUs; temperatures, fans and CPU power are not available yet)
